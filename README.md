[UNFINISHED] Summertime is a 2D platform endless game I built with C# in the Unity Game Engine. The goal of the game is to climb as high as possible. The player uses A and D to move left and right and W to jump. At the start of the game, blocks will begin falling from the sky. The player can use the mouse to click on blocks to freeze them and use them as platforms. Triangle blocks move faster and can knock the player off their spot. I never ended up finishing this game, but I made my own theme for it and sound effects, which I think is neat.
